# Git_explained_with_images
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps developers track changes in their source code during software development. 

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become the most widely used version control system in the world.

Here are key concepts associated with Git:

### Version Control

Git allows developers to keep track of changes in their codebase over time. This includes modifications, additions, and deletions of files.

### Distributed

Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the entire repository on their local machine. This allows for offline work and collaboration without a centralized server.

### Repositories

A Git repository is a collection of files and the entire history of changes made to those files. It can exist locally on a developer's machine or remotely on a server.

### Commits

A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier.

### Branching

Git uses branches to allow developers to work on features or fixes in isolation. Branches can be created, merged, and deleted, enabling parallel development.

### Merging

Merging combines changes from different branches. Developers can merge changes from a feature branch back into the main branch, for example.

### Pull Requests (or Merge Requests)

In collaborative development, developers propose changes to a repository through pull requests. This allows for code review before changes are merged into the main branch.

### Remote Repositories

Git supports working with remote repositories. Developers can clone repositories, fetch changes from remote repositories, and push changes to them.

### Staging Area

Before committing changes, developers can stage specific changes for inclusion in the next commit. This allows for more control over the commit process.

### Tagging

Git allows developers to create tags for specific commits, marking them as important points in the project's history, such as releases.

Git is widely used in the software development industry and is a crucial tool for collaboration, tracking changes, and ensuring code stability. 

It is supported by various platforms, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
